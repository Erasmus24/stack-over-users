# stack-over-users
An app which fetches Stack Overflow members from an API.

Instructions to running this app:
- Copy the repo URL
- Open your terminal, type 'git clone ' then paste the URL . Press enter.
- When the repo has been cloned into your machine, type 'cd <folder name>'. Replace <folder name> with the actual folder name then press enter.
- Now that you are in this folder, you must type 'npm i' to install all dependencies that are required. 
- When all has been installed, you must now type 'npm start'.
 
  It took me about two hours to do this assessment, I didn't want to take too long because to me it felt like that would be cheating.
  I still have to make the follow, like and search functionalities to work.
  The app compiles with some warnings for now but those warnings can be fixed.
